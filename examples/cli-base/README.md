# CLI BASE

This is a basic structure to create a command without passing the python command and the relative (or absolute) path for the python file.

----------

## Usage

### Install

Just execute:

    > bash install

and, all the requirements will be installed.

You can change the requirements.txt libs that you need.
Also change the num version on the file VERSION.txt

### Execute

Once the lib be installed, execute the command:

    > pycmd

to check if it works. The command name is just that: a custom name. You can change it as you want.
The documentation will be on setup.py file.

### Uninstall

Also, just execute:

    > bash uninstall

and all the libs installed should be uninstalled.

### Recomemdation

As a recommendation, we encourage you to create first in virtual environment first, just for testing purpose.
